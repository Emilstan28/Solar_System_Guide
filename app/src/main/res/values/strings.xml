        \nThe temperature in the core reaches 15 million degrees C (27 million degrees F), high enough to sustain the process of nuclear fusion
        \nThe temperature on the surface drops down to 5 500 degrees C (10 000 degrees F), while 3000 times smaller than the temperature of the core it\'s still enough to make carbon (like diamonds or graphite) boil.</string>

        active for just over 100 days Pioneer 5 has confirmed the existence of interplanetary magnetic fields among other accomplishments.
        \n\n<b>Pioneer 6-9</b>
        \n\nLaunched in the years of 1965-1968 they were, akin to their earlier sibling, a series of spin-stabilized probes that were meant to study the Sun and they did so with plenty of success.
        The first of the series, 6, was successfully contacted in 2000, 7 was last contacted in 1995 wherein it was confirmed that one of its scientific instruments were still running,
        8 in 1996, like the previous one, with one instrument functioning and finally 9 lost contact in 1983, in 1987 it was attempted to reconnect but the attempt failed and the spacecraft was declared inactive.
        \n\n<b>Pioneer E</b>

        magnetic fields and cosmic rays. The data from the probe was received in a German control center up until 1982.
        \n\n<b>Helios 2</b>
        \n\nThe probe launched on 15th of January 1976 it flew considerably closer to our parent star, 3 million kilometers (1.9 million miles) closer in fact. The probe gave us valuable insight to the solar plasma,
        cosmic rays and cosmic dust until contact was lost in 1980 when the transmitter aboard the craft failed. The probe was shut down in 1982 to prevent any possible radio interference with future missions.</string>

        being the first probe to achieve that.
        \n\nISEE-3 has monitored the incoming solar wind from 1978 to 1981, successfully completing all its objectives before NASA decided to extend its mission steering it to research the Earth magnetic tail as well as the first ever flyby of a comet.
        The extended mission ended in 1997, though the transmitter was left on and the orbit meant the probe would periodically flyby Earth. In 2014 fully crowd-funded efforts were made to recapture it, but they failed from lack of propellant.</string>

    <string name="wind_program">Wind</string>
    <string name="wind_program_text">\nLaunched on the 1st of November 1994 Wind was a part of international cooperation between USA, Japan and the European Space Agency, the International Solar Terrestrial Physics program (ISTP).
        It\'s intended target, the L1 Lagrange point between the Sun and Earth took until 1996, the reason being Wind was not the only spacecraft heading in that direction, with SOHO and ACE missions doing the same, while on hold
        it has conducted some magnetosphere research. It has done 19 lunar flybys, using the gravity assists to maintain the apogee of the orbit above the day hemisphere.
        \n\nWhen it got to its intended location Wind provided about an hour of warning about the state of solar wind for other ISTP spacecraft. In November 1998 Wind has begun a series of maneuvers to stray from the ecliptic plane,
        reaching 60 degrees deviation at most and giving us insight to the up to then unresearched regions of interplanetary space. It has returned to its intended position in 2004 where it has remained.
        \n\nDespite the programs conclusion in 2001 Wind continues to function, with predictions that it could stay at L1 for another 60 years. It plays a supporting role for other spacecraft researching our parent star.</string>

    <string name="soho_program_text">\nThe SOHO probe (Solar and Heliospheric Observatory) is an ESA sponsored contribution to the ISTP. It carries 12 instruments to study solar atmosphere, helioseismology and the solar wind.
        \n\nLaunched on 2nd of December 1995 it inserted into orbit around the L1 Lagrange point between the Sun and Earth on the 14th of February 1996. Communications were cut for 4 months starting in June 1998, after contact was regained
        in September the spacecraft was apparently spinning, not pointing at the sun. By September 25th the probe was back in control, with the loss of 3 of its onboard instruments.
        \n\nSOHO made several noteworthy discoveries, including locating the source of high-speed solar wind to the corners of the honeycomb shaped magnetic fields near the Sun\'s poles. Another one was the fact that by 2015,
        after 20 years of continuous work, SOHO has found over 3000 different comets, over half of what comets we know of by far. One of those comets were observed by the probe hurling at the Sun at the speed of 2.1 million kilometers per hour (1.3 million miles per hour).</string>

    <string name="ace_program_text">\nThe ACE probe (Advanced Composition Explorer) was designed to study spaceborne energy particles and establish commonalities between the Sun, Earth and Milky Way galaxy. \n\nIt has launched on the August
        25th 1997 and reached its intended position, the L1 point, in January 1998. Since then ACE has contributed near instant, constant stream of data regarding its results with all but one instrument functional. \n\nThe propellant on board
        theoretically could make the mission keep going until around 2024.</string>

        "The resting elevation for a component type is consistent across apps (e.g., FAB elevation "
        "does not vary from 6dp in one app to 16dp in another app).\n"
        "Components may have different resting elevations across platforms, depending on the depth "
        "of the environment (e.g., TV has a greater depth than mobile or desktop).\n\n"

        "Responsive elevation and dynamic elevation offsets.\n\n"

        "Some component types have responsive elevation, meaning they change elevation in response "
        "to user input (e.g., normal, focused, and pressed) or system events. These elevation "
        "changes are consistently implemented using dynamic elevation offsets.\n"
        "Dynamic elevation offsets are the goal elevation that a component moves towards, relative "
        "to the component’s resting state. They ensure that elevation changes are consistent "
        "across actions and component types. For example, all components that lift on press have "
        "the same elevation change relative to their resting elevation.\n"
        "Once the input event is completed or cancelled, the component will return to its resting "
        "elevation.\n\n"

        "Avoiding elevation interference.\n\n"

        "Components with responsive elevations may encounter other components as they move between "
        "their resting elevations and dynamic elevation offsets. Because material cannot pass "
        "through other material, components avoid interfering with one another any number of ways, "
        "whether on a per component basis or using the entire app layout.\n"
        "On a component level, components can move or be removed before they cause interference. "
        "For example, a floating action button (FAB) can disappear or move off screen before a "
        "user picks up a card, or it can move if a snackbar appears.\n"
        "On the layout level, design your app layout to minimize opportunities for interference. "
        "For example, position the FAB to one side of stream of a cards so the FAB won’t interfere "
        "when a user tries to pick up one of cards.\n\n"
