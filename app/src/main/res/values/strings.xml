    <string name="sun_rundown">Largest, and most massive object within our solar system, containing 99.8% of overall mass, \nOfficially classified as a yellow dwarf, the Sun is a comparatively small star

    <string name="sizes_and_distances">Sizes and distances</string>
    <string name="sun_sizes_and_distances_text">The Sun has a radius of 695,508 kilometers(432,168.6 miles).
        \nWhile our star isn\'t among the biggest around it\'s still very massive, 332,946 times more so than Earth.
        \nIt\'s 150 million kilometers(93 million miles) away from earth.
        \nThe nearest interstellar neighbor of our solar system is Alpha Centauri, 4.37 light years away.</string>

    <string name="orbit_and_rotation_sun_text">As a non-solid body different parts of The Sun rotate at different rates, at the equator one rotation takes 25 Earth days, at the poles that same action takes 36 days.
        \nOur solar system is moving at 720,000 kilometers per hour(450,000 miles per hour). Even at that speed it takes around 230 million years to make a full rotation around the Milky Way.</string>

    <string name="history_of_the_sun_text">The Sun was formed alongside the rest of our solar system, around 4.5 billion years ago.
        \nWhile forming it took over big majority of the material ending up with 99.8% of the entire combined mass of our solar system.
        \nThe scientists calculated that our parent star should be around for another 6.5 billion years, ending up as a white dwarf.</string>
    <string name="internal_structure">Internal structure</string>
    <string name="internal_structure_of_the_sun">The Sun is composed mainly of two elements hydrogen (which takes up 91% of overall composition) and helium (which takes up 8.9%).
        \It consists of six regions: the core, the radiative zone, and the convective zone in the interior,the surface (photosphere), the chromosphere and the corona.
        \nThe temperature in the core reaches 15 million degrees C (27 million degrees F), high enough to sustain the process of nuclear fusion
        \nThe temperature on the surface drops down to 5 500 degrees C (10 000 degrees F), while 3000 times smaller than the temperature of the core it\'s still enough to make carbon (like diamonds or graphite) boil.</string>
    <string name="the_inside_of_the_sun">The inside of the sun</string>
    <string name="atmosphere">Atmosphere</string>
    <string name="atmosphere_of_the_sun">The atmosphere of our parent star is relatively thin, within that region are where we can find the sunspots and solar flairs.
    \nWhat\'s interesting about that region is that the temperature once again rises up to 2 million degrees C (3.5 degrees F), the source of that heat remains unknown.</string>
