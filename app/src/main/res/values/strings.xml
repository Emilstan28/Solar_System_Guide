    \nWhile our star isn\'t among the biggest around it\'s still very massive, 332,946 times more so than Earth.
    \nIt\'s 150 million kilometers(93 million miles) away from earth, this distance serves as a basis for an Astronomical Unit(AU).
    \nThe nearest interstellar neighbor of our solar system is Alpha Centauri, 4.37 light years away.</string>

    <string name="orbitAndRotationSunText">As a non-solid body different parts of The Sun rotate at different rates, at the equator one rotation takes 25 Earth days, at the poles that same action takes 36 days.
    \nOur solar system is moving at 720,000 kilometers per hour(450,000 miles) per hour. Even at that speed it takes around 230 million years to make a full rotation around the Milky Way.</string>
